## Python 2.x

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, and included many major new features including a full garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed.

## Python 3.x

Python 3.0 (also called Python 3000 or py3k), a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on 3 December 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.

## Summary

* Your main goal should be just to learn Python. Be it 2.7 or 3.3. Once you get a command over the language, understanding both versions will be a matter of time.

* It doesn't really matter whether you use Python 2.7 or Python 3 If you do not use old features in Python 2.7, you can just 2to3 your code to make it run on Python 3.

* I would recommend learning Python 3.x if you are a beginner.
